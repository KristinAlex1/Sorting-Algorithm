This project is a visualizer for popular sorting algorithms—Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Bubble Sort—created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each sorting algorithm is demonstrated with visual bars that move in real-time, with accompanying sound effects for each comparison or swap, making it an engaging way to understand sorting mechanics.


## Features
- Visual demonstration of Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Bubble Sort.
- Real-time sound effects that play during each bar comparison or swap.
